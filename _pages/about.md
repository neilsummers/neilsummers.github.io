I try to figure out how to do stuff. I search the internet on how to do it. I can't find what I'm trying to do exactly. I figure it out from combining information from multiple sources. I write about what I did incase someone is trying to do the same. This blog is that.

I use tools that others build to manage my life. Sometimes it doesn't do what I want, or I think I can do it better. Sometimes that inspires me to do it myself instead of pay others for their work. I will also blog about that stuff too.

I used to be a Nuclear Physicist. Worked at LLNL for many years in the field of nuclear data. Went into tech working as a Data Scientist, mainly on Search problems. Worked for WalmartLabs and Atlassian. Currently just coding for myself, on whatever interests me.

I'm also an avid scratch golfer and like to compete in state amateur events in Northern California, and occasionally elsewhere. I enjoy looking into golf stats as it combines my passion for golf with my Data Science skills.

Mainly interested in Golf stats, Bitcoin analytics, algorithmic trading and Python programming.
