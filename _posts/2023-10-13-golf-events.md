This was made for 2023. I will not update for dates in 2024, but have made a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YmM3YmZhYzRmNDljZTdiZWFmZGUwY2E1NmZjMzVkNGRhMzliZmJiYWIxOGU3YzY3ZjBhYWE5N2VhNGJjOTQxN0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) for 2024 and beyond, in which I post the events and the event details in the descriptions.
{: .notice--info}

Doesn't seem to be a good website aggregating all the tournaments in the UK, so I'm making a few links for myself.
* <https://amateurgolf.com/> is not comprehensive for UK tournaments, it has some but not enough to be useful.
* <https://golfbible.co.uk/> is useful as a comprehensive list of tournament results, which actually has all the UK tournaments, but it is not searchable by country or region.
* <https://www.golfempire.co.uk/> comes up when searching for UK tournaments, and was recommended by playing partners over there, but is incomplete.
* <https://www.wagr.com/> is good for finding top level events, but only those that meet the WAGR criteria (3 rounds minimum).

After that it is probably best to search the local county golf union websites for their order of merit. A few examples.
* Surrey: <https://www.surreygolf.org/mens_merit>
* Berks, Bucks & Ox: <https://www.bbogolf.com/order_of_merits>
* Hampshire: <https://www.hampshiregolf.org.uk/order_of_merit>
* Dorset: <https://www.dcgu.org.uk/dorset_order_of_merit_2022>

Note many of the tournaments include practice rounds as part of the entry fee.
Most entries are determined by a ballot of the lowest indexes at close of entry.

## Majors

Judging by the WAGR points distribution, there are a few majors that are worth noting.
These are too big of tournaments for me, and Brabazon requires qualifying, which is hard to do from abroad.

* Lytham Trophy (566 WAGR points) - 4th week of April
* Irish Menâ€™s Amateur Open Championship (399 WAGR points) - 2nd week May
* English Men's Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship (Brabazon Trophy) (467 WAGR points) - 4th week of May
* Scottish Men's Open Championship (252 WAGR points) - 1st week June
* St Andrews Links Trophy (717 WAGR points) - 2nd week June

Some of the regional Open Championships in Scotland and Ireland look interesting, especially when at a course of note.

## England

### WAGR Events 2023
Events for 2023 but approximate dates stay the same in the calendar year-to-year. Not exhaustive and biased towards South of England and Links events. Filtered out all closed events such as County Championships and EGU closed competitions where you have to be a member of a club in the county or EGU to qualify.

### Non-WAGR Events
Some other events that don't meet WAGR criteria (mainly because they are less than 3 rounds), but they are at great courses and make good events to pair with WAGR events. Focus on Mid-Am and top venues.

## Ireland
Can get to play some great Irish Links courses through tournaments. Lahinch and Royal Portrush are definitely worth a trip over.

## Australia
Australia has a few big tournaments played at world top 100 courses that are worth a trip down under. Similar to the UK, entries are determined by handicap ballot, with no qualifying so simple to enter from abroad. Good for a wrap around season as their summer is our winter. Tournaments usually include a free practice round in the entry. Unlike the UK, they usually have only 1 round a day.

Events are well organized by Golf Australia with a full [calendar](https://www.golf.org.au/events#/customer/1090/schedule) available.

While NSW events are listed on this calendar, sometimes need to go to the NSW [calendar](https://www.golfnsw.org.au/event-calendar/) for NSW events.

Tournaments on my radar.

Have seen Port Phillip and Victorian Amateur played at other Melbourne Sandbelt courses including Royal Melbourne. The 2023 Port Phillip and Victorian Amateurs postponed to April 2024.

Australian Am, Avondale Am, and NSW Am make a nice long trip with back to back tournaments where several top England players come for winter golf.

2024 Australian Amateur at Yarra Yarra GC.
