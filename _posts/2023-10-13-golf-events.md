Doesn't seem to be a good website aggregating all the tournaments in the UK, so I'm making a few links for myself.
* <https://amateurgolf.com/> is not comprehensive for UK tournaments, it has some but not enough to be useful.
* <https://golfbible.co.uk/> is useful as a comprehensive list of tournament results, which actually has all the UK tournaments, but it is not searchable by country or region.
* <https://www.golfempire.co.uk/> comes up when searching for UK tournaments, and was recommended by playing partners over there, but is incomplete.
* <https://www.wagr.com/> is good for finding top level events, but only those that meet the WAGR criteria (3 rounds minimum).

After that it is probably best to search the local county golf union websites for their order of merit. A few examples.
* Surrey: <https://www.surreygolf.org/mens_merit>
* Berks, Bucks & Ox: <https://www.bbogolf.com/order_of_merits>
* Hampshire: <https://www.hampshiregolf.org.uk/order_of_merit>
* Dorset: <https://www.dcgu.org.uk/dorset_order_of_merit_2022>

Note many of the tournaments include practice rounds as part of the entry fee.
Most entries are determined by a ballot of the lowest indexes at close of entry.

## Majors

Judging by the WAGR points distribution, there are a few majors that are worth noting.
These are too big of tournaments for me, and Brabazon requires qualifying, which is hard to do from abroad.

* Lytham Trophy (566 WAGR points) - 4th week of April
* Irish Men’s Amateur Open Championship (399 WAGR points) - 2nd week May
* English Men's Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship (Brabazon Trophy) (467 WAGR points) - 4th week of May
* Scottish Men's Open Championship (252 WAGR points) - 1st week June
* St Andrews Links Trophy (717 WAGR points) - 2nd week June

Some of the regional Open Championships in Scotland and Ireland look interesting, especially when at a course of note.

## England

### WAGR Events 2023
Events for 2023 but approximate dates stay the same in the calendar year-to-year. Not exhaustive and biased towards South of England and Links events. Filtered out all closed events such as County Championships and EGU closed competitions where you have to be a member of a club in the county or EGU to qualify.

### Non-WAGR Events
Some other events that don't meet WAGR criteria (mainly because they are less than 3 rounds), but they are at great courses and make good events to pair with WAGR events. Focus on Mid-Am and top venues.

## Ireland
Can get to play some great Irish Links courses through tournaments. Lahinch and Royal Portrush are definitely worth a trip over.
